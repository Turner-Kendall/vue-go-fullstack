    <h5>Hey Now!</h5>
    <p>Thanks for stopping buy and checking out my project. I wanted to create a full stack starter kit, something that
      one could use to jump start a full stack project.
    </p>
    <p>This full stack uses Go on the back-end and Vue3 on the front-end.
      The back-end connects to a Postgres database and the front-end connects to the back-end via RESTful API calls
      using the Gin framework.</p>

    <h5>Build Once, Use Often</h5>
    <p>
      While I built this for me to use and reuse, I decided that maybe others could derive some value from it, so I
      decided to Open Source it
      and <a href="https://github.com/Turner-Kendall/vue-go-fullstack">share it on GitHub</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The backend handles authentication and authorization, database connection ( to Postgres DB) and the front-end
      provides
      the user interface. The front end is built with Vue3 and uses the Composition API along with Pico CSS for styling.
    </p>
    <p>
      This makes it super opinionated, but also super easy to get started with.
      I have included a few examples of how to use the back-end and front-end together, but you can use them separately
      as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="https://turnerkendall.com">Feel free to get in touch</a> if you have any questions or comments. I am
      always looking for ways to improve this project and make it better.

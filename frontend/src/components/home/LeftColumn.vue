    <h5>Hey Now!</h5>
    <p>Thanks for stopping buy and checking out my project. <a href="https://turnerkendall.com">I</a> wanted to create a full stack starter kit, somethng that
      one could use to jump start a full stack project. This full stack uses Go on the back-end and Vue3 on the front-end.
      The back-end connects to a Postgres database and the front-end connects to the back-end via RESTful API calls.

    <h5>Build Once, Use Often</h5>
    <p>
      While I built this for me to use and reuse, I hoped that maybe others could use it as well, so I decided to Open Source it
      and <a href="#">share it on GitHub</a>. The backend handles authentication and authorization, and the front-end provides
      the user interface.
